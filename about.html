		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Hello my name is Nickolas Fuentes, I am 22 years old and a senior in college. I am pursuing my degree at <a href="http://www.txstate.edu" target="_blank" title="Link to Texas State Univeristy"> Texas State University</a>, which I'm studying Mass Communications with a concentration in public relations and also a minor in business. I use to be a business major concentrating in marketing but I decided I wanted to take a different route. I wanted to take a more communicative part of a business so I changed my degree junior year. I wanted to be a voice for a basketball team or sports team whether that be from a public relations view or social media account manager, or even advertising. I chose to be a public relations manager so I can have a solid writing foundation. But I would like to try every part of the mass communications job opportunities and see which one I enjoy more.   </p>
		<p>Here are some of my favorite sports to watch in order</p>
